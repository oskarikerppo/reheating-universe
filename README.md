This project uses Python to calculate numerically the reheating temperature of the universe after an initial stiff-matter dominated phase.

Usage: 
- Install requirements.txt with pip (Python 3 recommended!)
- Run reheating_scenario.py with desired parameter intervals
- Run b_graph.py and load_results.py to obtain figures containing the results.
